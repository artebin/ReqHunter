In the framework of the RARE project<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot18"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="/usr/share/latex2html/icons/footnote.png"></SUP></A> at Space Applications Services, we had the need of a requirement management tool. After a review of the available tools, it seems that it is still difficult to find a software or a set of tools that is: (1) not necessarily user friendly but simple to use, (2) easy to install, (3) extendable to our business logic, and (4) that produces outputs as it was required in the RARE project.

<P>
Furthermore few other points lead us to work on this new tool. 

<P>
First is that we have discovered only few tools that allow to extract content from a Word document to constitute an initial version of a requirements database. This feature, i.e. to extract content from a Word document, is an important one because it is often the case that the first draft issued from a requirements listing process is written in a Microsoft Word document. Why this type of file? There are several reasons but the main is the multiple inputs: some inputs are coming from partners, others inputs are extracted from user questionnaires etc. In order to constitute a list of requirements, a Word document is hence the best choice since the requirements are the result a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">patchwork</SPAN> of documents and information. To be able to extract content from Word document is valuable and allow to constitute an initial version of a requirements database. 

<P>
However extracting content from a Word document is not an easy task, firstly because of the Word .doc format (it is easier with the .docx format), secondly the conception of a graphical user interface for enabling the user to specify the content to extract is not an easy task. In ReqHunter, writing Java code to extract content from a Word document (using Apache POI), but all the needed environment is available to do it properly.

<P>
The second point that leads us to work on ReqHunter is that the task of managing requirements may be improved by semantic and semantic web technologies. We have not seen such an approach in the review of the available requirements management software. The software do not include such semantic features for now. This is an open perspective and the project is a good candidate to develop it.
